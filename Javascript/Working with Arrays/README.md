## Traversing an Array
### Exercise 1: Print all the names in an array
### Exercise 2: Use forEach to print all the names in an array

## Projecting Arrays
Applying a function to a value and creating a new value is called a projection. To project one array into another, we apply a projection function to each item in the array and collect the results in a new array.

### Exercise 3: 
Project an array of videos into an array of {id,title} pairs using forEach()
For each video, add a projected {id, title} pair to the videoAndTitlePairs array.

### Exercise 4: Implement map()
To make projections easier, let's add a map() function to the Array type. Map accepts the projection function to be applied to each item in the source array, and returns the projected array.
